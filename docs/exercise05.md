# Exercise 5: MI Gitlab access by ssh

Under *Preferences/SSH Keys* the public SSH key of the local machine has
been added. This has for example been used to push the first three
exercises of this documentation to the MI Gitlab:

```txt
# git remote add origin git@gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de:sdi-dw084/sdi.git
# git push --set-upstream origin --all
